A program that will automatically backup your portable devices 
to a folder in your home directory, which is configurable.

Currently works with inotifywait (inotify tools). 
Need to implement HAL and udisks.


Currently there aren't very many instructions. So here goes.

-----------------------------

To install:

("BackupFolder" is whereever you want to place your backups)

Make the following folders:
BackupFolder/zdata/bin
BackupFolder/zdata/cache
BackupFolder/zdata/settings


Install backup-portable-drives to:
BackupFolder/zdata/bin/backup-portable-drives

and backup-portable-drives.conf to:
BackupFolder/zdata/backup-portable-drives.conf

Place your backup config (from example.conf) in
BackupFolder/zdata/settings

Run the program at (at computer startup):
BackupFolder/zdata/bin/backup-portable-drives

Backup will show up in
BackupFolder/<backup name>



--------------------------------

To configure:

Each backup config file start with:

# Drive id (program uses this to find and verify same drive)
# ID: 2345-4321

The "2345-4321" is your drive serial, though for now it just looks 
for a file called ".uuid-info" at the root of the portable drive
and sees if it contains that number.
