Only backup if there have actually been multiple changes
- check with rsync -n
- But we could be done by then....unless we have a lot of files to snapshot

Should mails keep coming for each day a backup is overdue,
or should that also be kept for the mail days.
If so, would have to restructure how mails are kept.
Perhaps ignore numbers?
